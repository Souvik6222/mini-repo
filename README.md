ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Souvik Biswas â€” a curious developer blending code with creativity.

ðŸ”§ Currently exploring the world of **JavaScript**, debugging logic, and building interactive features.  
ðŸŽ¨ Passionate about **design tools like Figma**, where I experiment with curved frames, transparency, and visual storytelling.  
ðŸ§  I enjoy customizing my dev environment with themes like JellyFish and optimizing workflows using **GitHub Copilot** and **VS Code extensions**.

ðŸ“¦ I believe in hands-on learning, persistent problem-solving, and creating tools that are both functional and beautiful.

ðŸš€ Let's build something cool together.
