👋 Hey there! I'm Souvik Biswas — a beginner web developer passionate about turning ideas into clean, creative websites.

💻 Currently learning:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for style
- **JavaScript** for interactivity (soon!)

🎨 I love exploring design tools like **Figma** and customizing my coding environment with cool themes and extensions in **VS Code**.

🛠️ I'm also experimenting with **GitHub Copilot** to boost my workflow and learn smarter.

📚 Every day is a new chance to build, break, and learn — follow along as I grow from beginner to builder!
